# THLFramework

*A game framework developed for the THL: 48h contest.*

Once upon a time (2004), we organized a 48h video game programming contest. The contest itself
had a modest participation, but nonetheless the event got mentioned in the Yearbook of the 
Spanish Society of Editors and Entertainment Software (aDeSe).

This game framework was intended as a way to provide participants with a fast prototyping 
framework to try to squeeze as much as possible in 48h.
